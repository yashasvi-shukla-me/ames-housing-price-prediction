# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

### This is a simple roadmap/flowchart

### The dataset used here is the Ames House Price Dataset

Follow this for simple easy workflow.

### Before beginning to do anything

- Create a folder called House Price Prediction or anyname you prefer.

- Then create a seprate virtual environmet to work in.

**What is an “environment” in Python?**

Think of it like a big common kitchen used by everyone.

If you install libraries there, they mix with other projects and can break things.
So professionals create a private kitchen per project.
That private kitchen is called a virtual environment (venv).

## Step 1:

Create a basic folder structure like

- ames-housing-ml/

- ames/
- data/
- src/
- models/
- notebooks/
- README.md

## Step 2:

- Install the libraries ( the tools that you will be working with )
- install the basic libraries, we can install others when required

`pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn lightgbm joblib python-dotenv`

## Step 3:

- Load the dataset both, train.csv and test.csv
- Download them from Kaggle

## Step 4:

### Data Preprocessing

- Here we will do data cleaning
- We will handle the missing values
- After that we will prepare the features
